# Driver_TM4C123GH6PMI
The purpose of the repository is to develop Device Drivers for TM4C123GH6PMI microcontroller

The microcontroller is present in the Evaluation Kit EK-TM4C123GXL. The drivers are developed from scratch. The from the scratch development includes
    1. Writing Make file
    2. Writing Linker Script
    3. Writing Startup file
    4. Configuring Visual Studio Code to abstract the development process(i.e. and attempt to use VSCode as an IDE for our project)
